# Exam Manager App

A full-stack Laravel MVC application with CRUD functionality, built to manage university exam records. Users can create, view, and edit exams, while admins have full control, including delete access. The project uses Laravel Breeze for authentication and Tailwind CSS for styling. Exam grades are color-coded for quick visual feedback.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- User registration and login (Laravel Breeze)
- Role-based access:
  - **User** can view and add/edit exam records
